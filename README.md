# Andorid Darkmode Wallpaper Changer ðŸŒ›

First off, this is my first Android App in years and I also haven't used Kotlin in over 3 years so do not expect amazing quality code here. But still - it works.

With that out of the way...

## What does this super epic App do now?

One of my favorite features on iOS since iOS 13 is Darkmode, more specificly, that your Homescreen Background can change with your current theme. 
Yet for some reason I haven't found an App that allows you to do the same on Android, since with Android 10 Google instroduced Dark Mode as well.

This App simply allows you to pick two images, one for "lightmode" and one for darkmode. Whenever your System-Theme changes, so does the background.
This is made possible through an Live-Wallpaper that always display the correct image.

## Where to download this bad boy?

Well since you are here - you can download the ad-free open source version right here :  https://github.com/tfuerholzer/AndoridDarkModeWallpaperChanger/releases/
This App will also make onto the Playstore but since Google charges me for that, I will add ads - so if you want to support me. Go ahead.
